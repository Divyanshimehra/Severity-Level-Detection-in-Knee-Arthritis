# Severity-Level-Detection-in-Knee-Arthritis
A CNN-based model for detecting the severity of a patient's medical condition by analyzing his/her X-ray image. Implemented the CNN model in an application developed using Python.

Developed this project in 2023 during my 1st semester of Masters.  

Later I had the honor of presenting my research paper on "Detecting Severity Level of Knee Osteoarthritis using CNN" at the 15th International Conference on Computing, Communication and Networking Technologies (ICCCNT'24), held at Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi.
The research paper got published in Scopus indexed IEEE ICCCNT conference as well.
